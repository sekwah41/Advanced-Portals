# Contributing to Advanced Portals

Just generally sick to the coding style and layout style you see in the current project, it will just speed up pull requests. Useful requests will still be accepted if the style is wrong though will take longer as they will need to be changed by me or another key programmer to the project (if there are more at the time of requesting)

More info coming soon
