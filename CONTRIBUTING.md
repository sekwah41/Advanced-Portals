# Contributing to Advanced Portals

Just generally sick to the coding style and layout style you see in the current project, it will just speed up pull requests. Useful requests will still be accepted if the style is wrong though will take longer as they will need to be changed by me or another key programmer to the project (if there are more at the time of requesting)

Just make sure to fill out the pull request template properly. If one of the fields doesnt apply just remove it or put None as the only bullet point.

More info coming soon
