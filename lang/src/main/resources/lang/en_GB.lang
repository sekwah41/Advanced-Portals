# Same as default minecraft lang files but can handle comments if a # is the first character
# Anything not set in translations will be defaulted back to the en_GB file.
# The default en_GB will always be loaded before any other file, even if you make a new en_GB so that new strings
# do not have blank values possibly making new features unusable.
#
# The format of included strings is %(number of argument)$s  (starts at 1 not 0)
# So the order of variables being inserted into the string is not a set order. Just like minecraft
#
# For colors use & or §
# &0   Black
# &1   Dark Blue
# &2   Dark Green
# &3   Dark Aqua
# &4   Dark Red
# &5   Dark Purple
# &6   Gold
# &7   Gray
# &8   Dark Gray
# &9   Blue
# &a   Green
# &b   Aqua
# &c   Red
# &d   Light Purple
# &e   Yellow
# &f   White
# &k   Obfuscated
# &l   Bold
# &m   Strikethrough
# &n   Underline
# &o   Italic
# &r   Reset

# Some debug messages may not be listed here for translation.
