Need to write a new readme for this.

Also I will set up release please to work with the below types for pretty changelogs.

The re-code is based off a mix of the original version, and the original re-code that was abandoned [see here](https://github.com/sekwah41/Advanced-Portals/tree/recode/src/main/java/com/sekwah/advancedportals).

There were no issues with this approach, though for a number of reasons outside of the codebase progress was not made fast enough.

## Scopes available
The scopes available should be the specific modules being worked on. E.g. core, spigot, docs

## Documentation
That is handled on the [website](https://github.com/sekwah41/Advanced-Portals/tree/website) branch.

At some point I may merge this onto this branch to try to push for documentation changes with new features, though for now this works.
