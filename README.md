# API

The api isn't implemented in this version, sorry for any inconvenience. Check the recode tree for possibly a working recode at some point.

# Contribution
If you are going to change any of the reflection make sure you test it against the suggested supported versions at the moment e.g. 1.13 as well as 1.14 otherwise most will be accepted from just reviewing the code unless it changes something drastic which would effect other functionality in a bad way.
