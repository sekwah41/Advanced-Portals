## Scopes available
The scopes available should be the specific modules being worked on. E.g. core, spigot, docs

## Documentation
That is handled on the [website](https://github.com/sekwah41/Advanced-Portals/tree/website) branch.

At some point I may merge this onto this branch to try to push for documentation changes with new features, though for now this works.
