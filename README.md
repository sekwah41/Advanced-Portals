<p>To get the needed bukkit versions download the spigot buildtools and run the appropriate commands for the versions listed in the pom file.</p>
<p>e.g. "java -jar BuildTools.jar --rev 1.10.2" (Enter this into git bash)</p>

<p>Use the versions to test code before you turn it into reflection or suggest it to be turned into reflection.</p>

<p>You should never use direct craftbukkit references in public builds as it would only work in one spigot version</p>
