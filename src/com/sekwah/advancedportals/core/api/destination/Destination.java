/**
 * Possibly look at adding the ability to add some tags to destinations such as permissions. Would make it easier
 * to add permissions to block access to certain areas and such. Could be a different permission system or just
 * it takes the tags on the destination and automatically applies them when a portal wants to warp to there.
 * (Of course it would not work cross server unless the data was communicated and checked first however that
 * could effect performance and would definitely effect speed)
