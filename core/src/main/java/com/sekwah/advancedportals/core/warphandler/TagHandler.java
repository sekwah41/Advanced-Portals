 * If a tag can be used for any of them then either make it cast the target or if it doesnt need a target

 *
 * Will probably make better documentation on how to do so or some tutorial videos though take a look at the source code
 * on github for how the current tags are added.
 *
 * Also not sure if its good practice or not in java however these all extend TagHandler so they can be accepted in 1
 * method nicer than if they didn't
